# Machine-Generated Text Detection using RoBERTa Language Model

This repository contains code and resources for detecting machine-generated text using the RoBERTa language model. The project includes a notebook and a paper submitted for Semeval 2024 - Task 8.

## Introduction

The detection of machine-generated text has become increasingly important due to the proliferation of automated content generation systems. This project aims to address this issue by utilizing RoBERTa, a state-of-the-art language model, for identifying machine-generated text.

## Contents

* notebook.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the code for text detection using RoBERTa.

To use the code provided in the notebook, follow these steps:

``` bash
# 1. Clone the repository:
# 2. Install the necessary dependencies. You can use pip:
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Open and run the notebook.ipynb file in a Jupyter environment such as colab.
Follow the instructions and execute the cells to perform machine-generated text detection using RoBERTa.
